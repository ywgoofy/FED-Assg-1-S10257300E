PROJECT OVERVIEW

Project: Kessoku Band Website
The bands name is "Kessoku Band". This is a fictional band from the anime Bocchi The Rock. The band's origin is Japan. The website will include a Home Page, a shopping page and a newsletter page. 
The goal is to create a website that will help Kessoku Band connect with their fans and achieve their goals of selling more music and merchandise, and booking more gigs. The website will provide fans with a central location to learn more about the band, connect with them on social media, and purchase their music and merchandise. The band also benefits because the website helps them reach a wider audience, sell more music and merchandise, and book more gigs. Our target audience include Kessoku Band's fans and potential new fans.

DESIGN PROCESS

I began the design process by conducting user research to better understand the needs of Kessoku Band's fans and potential fans. I also researched the websites of other bands in order to identify best practices and trends.

Based on my research, I created a set of user personas to represent the different types of users who would be visiting the website. I then used these personas to inform my design decisions.
1. As a fan of Kessoku Band, I want to kno when their tour is happening, where and how much it will cost.
2. As a potential fan of Kessoku Band, I want to discover their music and social media handles to find out if I like the music and what they do, so that I can become a fan.

I next created a series of wireframes to map out the structure and layout of the website. I also created a style guide to define the website's color palette, fonts, and typography.
