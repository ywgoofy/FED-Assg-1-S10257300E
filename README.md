PROJECT OVERVIEW

Project: Kessoku Band Website
The bands name is "Kessoku Band". This is a fictional band from the anime Bocchi The Rock. The band's origin is Japan. The website will include a Home Page, a shopping page and a newsletter page. 
The goal is to create a website that will help Kessoku Band connect with their fans and achieve their goals of selling more music and merchandise, and booking more gigs. The website will provide fans with a central location to learn more about the band, connect with them on social media, and purchase their music and merchandise. The band also benefits because the website helps them reach a wider audience, sell more music and merchandise, and book more gigs. Our target audience include Kessoku Band's fans and potential new fans.

DESIGN PROCESS

I began the design process by conducting user research to better understand the needs of Kessoku Band's fans and potential fans. I also researched the websites of other bands in order to identify best practices and trends.

Based on my research, I created a set of user personas to represent the different types of users who would be visiting the website. I then used these personas to inform my design decisions.
1. As a fan of Kessoku Band, I want to kno when their tour is happening, where and how much it will cost.
2. As a potential fan of Kessoku Band, I want to discover their music and social media handles to find out if I like the music and what they do, so that I can become a fan.

I next created a series of wireframes to map out the structure and layout of the website. I also created a style guide to define the website's color palette, fonts, and typography.

The link to the wireframe in Figma can be found here:

TECHNOLOGIES USED

HTML:
The standard markup language for creating web pages. I used HTML to structure the content of the website and make it readable by web browsers.
CSS:
A language for styling web pages. I used CSS to control the appearance of the website, including the colors, fonts, and layout.

Figma:
To create the wireframes of the website
GitHub:
A code hosting platform. I used GitHub to store the website's code and collaborate with others.

TESTING

The website generally works for mobile devices and desktops. 

Homepage:
The homepage has 3 icon buttons that brings the user outside the website. it does this well and thre havent been any issues with this after testing.
The buttons in the homepage all work as intened and the designs are all working properly after multiple rounds of testing.

Tour Page:
The tour page doesnt have much features. The purpose of the tour page is to just provide information of the tour to the fans as they would need the information to buy the tickets.

Shop Page: 
The shop page shows a catalog of items and has an add to cart button for each item as well as a checkout button all the way at the bottom. The buttons work perfectly fine however, so far, the checkout button and the add to cart buttons dont really do anything yet. 

Music page:
The music page comprises of a spotify playlist to allow the fans to listen to kessoku bands songs and maybe pull in some potential fans too. The playlist is thre for anyone to listen to in case they havent already listened to all their songs.
